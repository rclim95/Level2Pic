# Level2Pic

Level2Pic is a simple desktop app that allows you to make maps of levels made in Super Mario Flash v3.0, a fan-made Mario game by [pouetpu](http://www.pouetpu-games.com/).

## Features

* Load levels from a Super Mario Flash v3.0 level code directly or from a website
* See a preview of your level map before saving it or copying it to a clipboard
* View interesting information or statistics about a level

## Background

I initially started this project back when I was obsessed with Super Mario Flash around 2010 - 2011. 

Back in the day, I used to frequent (the now defunct) Super Mario Flash / Super Mario Flash Extra Forums and post my Super Mario Flash levels there for people to play and/or rate. One of the things I would also do was post a map of the levels I've made so that people can get a good look of what to expect while playing my levels.

To make these level maps, I would initially take section-by-section screenshots of the level with Super Mario Flash level editor, and stitch it all together using Paint.NET, and then post the level map. The whole stitching process to create a level map was painfully slow. Then suddenly, I had the realization that I could easily automate through the power of C# programming, and that's how Level2Pic was born. 😄

Since then, I haven't been maintaining this project as life got in the way and I lost interest in Super Mario Flash. ☹ Given the fact that I started this project back when I was still getting the ropes of programming, there are bound to be silly and/or bad practice/design/engineering choices in this codebase. In fact, while reading through my own code now (in 2018), there's a lot moment where I've given myself a _face-palm_. 😅 If anything though, I want to say that the experience I gained from this project served as a stepping stone for me to become a better programmer in the process. 🙂
