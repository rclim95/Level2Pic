Level2Pic v2.5.0.0 - 2011
    - NEW:      Links to the Level Portal and Super Mario Flash have been added (available via the Help menu)
    - NEW:      You can now edit the properties of a Super Mario Flash level code.
    - NEW:      You can now set the default zone(s) to render when you load a new level
    - NEW:      View the tiles used, the number of time it have been used, and the percentage the tile makes up the level.
    - CHANGE:   Level2Pic's classes that renders the level and gathers level information have been moved into its own file. .NET Framework Developers who uses a supported language (VB.NET, C#, for example) can use this to retrieve level information or even create a level map (must supply graphics however).
    - CHANGE:   The way Level2Pic draws a level map and renders it.
    - CHANGE:   Some dialogs have minor interface changes
    - CHANGE:   Some minor changes to the main Level2Pic window
    - CHANGE:   In the "Property" panel of the main Level2Pic window, the list of available properties to set have been removed. It have been compacted into one "page."
    - CHANGE:   Critical errors aren't shown automatically when you load a level with errors. View the "Error and Warning" dialog in order to see the critical errors.
    - CHANGE:   You can now turn on or turn off the ability to create a level map automatically as soon as you load it
    - CHANGE:   You can now turn on or turn off the ability to preview a level
    - CHANGE:   Sprites and backgrounds have been "compacted" into its two files: Tiles and Enemies.png and Backgrounds.png
    - CHANGE:   Level2Pic doesn't automatically check for updates unless you explicitly allow it to check for updates via Help -> Check for Updates
	- REMOVE:	The ability to move the toolbar all over the place
	- REMOVE:   The ability to view the properties information in the "Multiple Level Found" dialog.
    - REMOVE:	"Set Default Properties" in the Tools menu. You can go to Tools -> Options -> Default Properties tab.
	- REMOVE:   The pie chart found in the "Properties" dialog. It required an unnecessary library, and when it isn't installed, Level2Pic complains about a missing library.
